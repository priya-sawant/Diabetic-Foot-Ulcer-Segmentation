# Diabetic-Foot-Ulcer-Segmentation
The goals of this project are: to create and test a deep learning system for automatically identifying diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs); to identify best performing deep learning model.
Normally Physicians rely heavily on images to offer accurate diagnosis and treatment of ulcers, and to determine the extent of the ulcer and give precise measurement for therapy. However, this manual procedure takes a long time and requires a high degree of expertise. Therefore, using deep learning methods helps to automate ulcer segmentation processes. So, this project seeks to identify the best image segmentation method.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48020934/194842641-5958c4f1-6be0-42c1-9e37-b33e705f9bb5.png)

The Dice Similarity Coefficient for the U-Net++ network was 93.29%. In contrast, the Dice Similarity Coefficient of the U-Net network was 86.63%, while the Ensemble model (U-Net + LinkNet) was 51.37%. The results reveal that the U-Net++ model delivers the best DFU segmentation results.
